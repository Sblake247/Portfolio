Since then, the program has grown\nto a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations\nacross Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station\nin the system anytime.\n\n### The Business Task\n\nHow do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n\nNote: Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable\nthan casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers,\nMoreno (Director of Marketing) believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. \n\n### Stakeholders and Team\n\nLily Moreno: The director of marketing \n\nCyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for\ncollecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy\n\nCyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide\nwhether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n\n### Description of data sources\n(12) 2023 monthly csv files containing \nride_id: ID attached to each ride taken\nrideable_type: bike type electric or classic\nstarttime: day and time trip started, in CST\nstoptime: day and time trip ended, in CST\nstart_station_name\nstart_station_id\nend_station_name\nend_station_id\nstart_lat: starting latitude\nstart_lng:starting longitude\nend_lat: ending latitude\nend_lng: ending longitude\nmember_casual: type of rider membership or daypass\n\nOne csv file contining station information \nid: station id\nname: station name\nlatitude of the station \nlongitude of the station\ndpc capacity: how many docking stations \nlandmark\nonline data: the date the station went live in the system","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### This is a ficticious Case Study \n(Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic\nis a fictional company.\n\n### DATA \n The data has been made available by\nMotivate International Inc. under this license.https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Choice for this notebook\nI am going to try this in SQL lite to showcase my skills and my thought processes.

Summary\n\nThe season for the bike share satrts in March and peaks around July and August with members lasting longer into September. \nCasual riders tend to use the bike share on the weekends with members using the bike share during the week. There are large areas for conversion at the #1 ranked station with 4000 casual rides taken from that station and 6000 membership rides. It looks like this area could be a good target area for commuters. Same with the #2 ranked station. \nThere are twice as many membership riders as there are casual riders, showing a trend moving from casual riders to memberships. \nBoth members and casual riders use electric bikes over classic bikes. With casual riders taking rides twice as long as members. \n\n### Recommendations \n\nTarget Top 4 stations to convert casual members to memberships. Give discounted rate to commuters in that area for membership. Adverize in local businesses around top stations. Advertize in events around those areas. ","metadata":{}}]}
